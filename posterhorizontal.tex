\begin{block}{Introduction}

Cultural evolution theories \cite{mesoudi} provide a set of methods that can be used to account these dynamic of changes, focused on the production of olive oil amphorae during the Roman Empire. 
To achieve this goal, multivariate methods were used to evaluate the differences on the pattern production among pottery workshops \cite{agui}. \\
Specifically we want to identify the origin of these changes and if these changes were produced by cultural reasons depending on the spatial distance and other cultural constraints. As hypothesis, we propose that spatial distribution of pottery workshops is the main influence of the making techniques processes \cite{schillinger}. Four pottery workshops, showed in the map \textbf{(fig.1)} were studied from different spaces in \emph{Baetica}. 
\end{block}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/fig1.png}
    \caption{Distribution map of the four amphorae workshops. The names are Las Delicias (\'Ecija, Seville), Bel\'en and Malpica (Palma del R\'io, C\'ordoba) and Parlamento (Seville)}

\end{figure}


\begin{block}{Methods}

{\textbf{Measurements}} 

To explore the dynamic of changes we analysed a set of measures among different kinds of amphorae shapes from different workshops. We analysed 413 samples of amphorae from 4 different workshops. These workshops were selected from different spaces of \emph{Baetica} area in order to know if there were differences depending on the space. A database was created using a selection of 80 to 90 samples from each pottery workshops. In each sample of amphora we measured eight measurements among different part of the rim being focused on the rim of the amphora.

with the eight measurements as variables. \\
Principal Component Analysis allowed us to simplify the dataset to see which variable were more relevant. 
Our results suggested that first and second principal component were more relevant than the rest.

\begin{block}{Results}
\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}

\justify
Several multivariate methods were used such as Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Analysis to classify. These methods allowed us to know the differences on the pattern production among workshops.In our case, the first two principal components were taken to see the significal differences among workshops depending on the space. The \textbf{figure 2} shows the workshops with a minor space such Bel\'en and Malpica share more pottery traits than the rest: Parlamento and Las Delicias.
\begin{figure}
    \input{images/schemaTL.tikz}
\end{figure}


Once defined the components, we used Discriminant Analysis to find a combination among them to define the groups as well as possible. These results were translated to a confusion matrix which basically means what results were predicted as true or false on the discriminant analysis. 


\begin{figure}
    \begin{tabular}{m{8cm}m{8cm}}

    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}
\end{column}

\begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}

\justify
 Thus the system had troubles to distinguishing between Bel\'en and Malpica which had a higher number of confusion or number instead of Parlamento with a minor confusion than the rest.

	    &
	    \includegraphics[height=8cm]{images/cubeC.png}\\
	    

	\end{tabular}
    \end{figure}
 

\justify
As shown in the \textbf{figure 3} of confusion, all correct guesses were located in the diagonal of the table.\\
A peer to peer comparison was developed among different workshops. We calculated the geographical distance between each site and the distance among pottery measures, calculated using the previous results. The \textbf{figure 4}  shows that the pottery distance is correlated with the spatial distance of workshops.

\begin{block}{Concluding Remarks}

Differences among pottery workshops were identified using PCA and Discriminant Analysis. As results, Amphorae made in nearby workshops with a minor spacial distance, such as Malpica and Bel\'en, share more traits than amphorae made in pottery workshops farther as Parlamento. It could suggest that the pottery techniques were learned from master to disciple instead of workers with the same level .
