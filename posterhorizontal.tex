\begin{block}{Introduction}

\justify

Material culture variability allows us to understand the interpretation of the change processes~\cite{lycett}. In particular, we want to identify changes on the amphorae production and if making techniques processes were related with the spatial distribution~\cite{bjo}. We think that amphorae made in nearby workshops may share more similar traits than amphorae made from farthest workshops. As hypothesis, production techniques would be vertically transmitted based on the learning from master to disciple instead of horizontal transmission where this learning is done by workers with the same level. Empirical studies and theoretical model were proposed to test this hypothesis.
 
  
\end{block}


\begin{block}{Dataset}

\justify
We analyzed 413 amphorae (fig.\ref{fig:betica}~(b)) from 4 different workshops located in \emph{Baetica} (fig.\ref{fig:betica}~(a)). Amphorae production in this province was really important and active during 300 years in the Roman Empire. The workshops were selected from different sites of \emph{Baetica} province in order to know if morphometric distance was correlated with spatial distance. A set 90 samples from each workshop were used to create a database. 8 measures focused on the rim were taken from each amphorae sample.

{\textbf{Principal Component Analysis}} 
\justify

PCA was used to explore these metrical observations with the 8 measurement as variables. Results allow us to simplify the analysis by grouping the variance of the dataset. The first two principal components were chosen to see the significant differences among workshops. 

\vspace{1cm}
{\textbf{Results}}\\
\justify
Figure~\ref{fig:pca} suggests that amphorae from closer workshops tend to be more similar. Most of the workshops have different signals on PC1 (i.e. Bel\'en, Delicias and Malpica) while Parlamento shows a distinctive pattern on PC2.

{\textbf{Model \& Experiment}}\\
\justify
In this part we propose a model based on the Wright-Fisher's random drift model to see what condition can lead to the variation revealed by the PCA. 
%In this model workshops produce a certain number of amphorae \& can: (1) change their production technics following a random inovation procedure (vertical transmission) or (2) copy the production techniques of another workshop.  
An algorithmic description of it is given in the Fig~\ref{fig:mod}~(a).  %where a fixed number of workshop produce a fixed amount of amphora during a certain time following a certain techniques. Every 100 time step each workshop have a certain probability to slightly modify their production technique (\emph{ie} the vertical tramsission) or to copy the one used by another workshop (\emph{the horizontal transmission}).

%{\textbf{Horizontal Transmission}}\\

To test the impact of horizontal vs vertical transmission (HT vs VT) on the variation in production between the workshops, we simplify the problem by focusing on the variation of only one trait. To mesure the impact of HT we introduce a bias toward the closest neighbour : workshops farer to $WS_0$ have lesser chance to make a cultural copy.

{\textbf{Result}}\\
\justify
If the probability of horizontal transfer of knowledge between workshop is high the variation between the production is low. If the probability of cultural transfer is low, the variability is high, till it reaches its maximum where no horizontal transfer is allowed.

\begin{block}{Concluding Remarks}
\justify

Empirical studies identified a variation on the making techniques processes among pottery workshops. We observe that this variability is affected by the distance: amphorae made in nearby workshops with a minor spacial distance share more similar traits than amphorae made in pottery workshops farther. It suggests that the pottery techniques were learned from master to disciple instead of workers with the same level. 

The combination of this empirical analysis with the theoretical model suggests that horizontal transmission was not the main cultural process in the workshops. This result, combined with the correlation between spatial distance and morphometric distance suggests that vertical transmission is probably the most probable mechanism.

This is yet just a preliminary results as both the empirical and the theoretical analysis need to be improved: each one using the result of the other. 

%the first on by collecting more data from other sites to see if the inter-workshop variation is still consistent with isolation by distance ; the second one by bringing closer the model to the case study by make co-variate as variable as in the empirical study and by integrating the observed correlation between the variable.
