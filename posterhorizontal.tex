\begin{block}{Introduction}

Material culture variability allows to understand the interpretation of the change processes, focused on the production of olive oil amphorae (called Dressel 20) during the Roman Empire. \\
In particular, we want to identify changes on the pattern productions and if these changes were produced by economical and political reasons ~\cite{schillinger_differences_2016}. As
hypothesis, we think that making techniques processes were transmitted by vertical transmission based on the learning production techniques from master to disciple instead of horizontal transmission where this learning is done by workers with the same level. If this hypothesis is validated amphorae made in nearby workshops should share more traits than amphorae made from farthest workshops. Empirical studies and theoretical model were propose to test this hypothesis. 
\end{block}


\begin{block}{Dataset}


    We analysed a sample of 413 amphora shapes from 4 different workshops showed in the map \textbf{(fig.\ref{fig:betica})}.These workshops were selected from different sites of \emph{Baetica} province in order to know if morphometric distance was correlated with spatial distance. A set 90 samples from each workshop were used to create a database. 8 measures focused on the rim were taken from each amphorae sample.

{\textbf{Principal Component Analysis}} 
\justify

PCA was used to explore these metrical observations with the 8 measurement as variables. Results allow us to simplify the analysis by grouping the variance of the dataset. The first two principal components were chosen to see the significant differences among workshops.

{\textbf{Results}}\\
\justify
Figure~\ref{fig:pca} shows that the closest workshops in space (Bel\'en and Malpica) produce more similar pottery traits than the farer workshops Parlamento and Las Delicias.

{\textbf{Model}}\\
\justify
We propose a model implementing the Wright-Fisher view of Random Drift, where a fixed number of workshop produce a fixed amount of amphora during a certain time following a certain techniques. Every 100 time step each workshop have a certain probability to slightly modify their production technique (\emph{ie} the vertical tramsission) or to copy the one used by another workshop (\emph{the horizontal transmission}).

			\EndFor
		\EndLoop
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

{\textbf{Horizontal Transmission}}\\
\justify
To test the impact of horizontal transmission on the variation in production between the workshop we simplify the problem by focusin on the study of the variation of only one traits. We also introduce a penalties: workshops farer to $WS_0$ have lesser chance to make a cultural copy ($p=f(d)$ with $d$ the distance to $WS_0$)

{\textbf{Result}}\\
\justify
If the probability of horizontal transfer of knowledge between workshop is high the variation between the production is low. If the probability of cultural transfer is low, the variability is high, till it reaches its maximum where no horizontal transfer is allowed.

\begin{block}{Concluding Remarks}

Empirical studies identified a variation on the making techniques processes among pottery workshops. We observe that this variability is affected by the distance: amphorae made in nearby workshops with a minor spacial distance share more traits than amphorae made in pottery workshops farther. It suggests that the pottery techniques were learned from master to disciple instead of workers with the same level. 

The theoretical model support those claim as it shows that when introducing the possibility of horizontal transmission between the workshop the diversity of production quickly decrease.
