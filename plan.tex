\section{Introduction}
%Cultural evolution theories provide a set of methods that can be used to account these dynamic of changes, focused on the production of olive oil amphorae during the Roman Empire. 
%To achieve this goal, multivariate methods were used to evaluate the differences on the pattern production among pottery workshops. \\
%Specifically we want to identify the origin of these changes and if these changes were produced by cultural reasons depending on the spatial distance and other cultural constraints. As hypothesis, we propose that spatial distribution of pottery workshops is the main influence of the making techniques processes \cite{schillinger}. Four pottery workshops, showed in the map \textbf{(fig.1)} were studied from different spaces in \emph{Baetica}.

\section{Empirical Studies}
\subsection{Methods}

{\textbf{Measurements}} \\

We analysed a sample of 413 amphorae shapes from 4 different workshops.These workshops were selected from different sites of \emph{Baetica} province in order to know if morphometric distance was correlated with spatial distance. A set 90 samples from each workshop were used to create a database. 8 measures focused on the rim were taken from each amphorae sample.

{\textbf{Principal Component Analysis}} \\
 
 
\subsection{Results}

%Several multivariate methods were used such as Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Analysis to classify. These methods allowed us to know the differences on the pattern production among workshops.In our case, the first two principal components were taken to see the significal differences among workshops depending on the space. The \textbf{figure 2} shows the workshops with a minor space such Bel\'en and Malpica share more pottery traits than the rest: Parlamento and Las Delicias.

%\end{figure}
%
%Once defined the components, we used Discriminant Analysis to find a combination among them to define the groups as well as possible. These results were translated to a confusion matrix which basically means what results were predicted as true or false on the discriminant analysis. 
%
% Thus the system had troubles to distinguishing between Bel\'en and Malpica which had a higher number of confusion or number instead of Parlamento with a minor confusion than the rest.

%As shown in the \textbf{figure 3} of confusion, all correct guesses were located in the diagonal of the table.\\
%A peer to peer comparison was developed among different workshops. We calculated the geographical distance between each site and the distance among pottery measures, calculated using the previous results. The \textbf{figure 4}  shows that the pottery distance is correlated with the spatial distance of workshops.

\section{Theoretical Exploration}
\subsection{Model}
We propose a simple model where a fixed number of workshop are producing a fixed amount of amphora during a certain time. 

To simplify the problem the amphora production is describe by only one measure among the measure previously observed (external diameter) and each workshop produce amphora where this measure follow a normal distribution. The parameter of this normal distribution (the mean value and the standard deviation) are the cultural knowledge that workshop can or cannot exchange given the different setup. Every 100 time step each workshop have a certain probability to modify those parameter and/or to copy the one used by another workshop. 

To calibrate the model we choose to use the measure that exhibit the more inter-workshop variation: the size of the protruding rim. We can observe the distribution of this mesure in the Figure~\ref{fig:prot}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/prot.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Size of the protruding rim for all amphora studied in Each workshop}
    \label{fig:prot}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
We create 4 different experimental setup that help us to test the impact of the horizontal transmission on the evolution of the variation in production of amphora given different penalities between each workshop. In two case the vertical transmission (\emph{ie} the copy of the parameter of the normal distribution) (left column of the Figure~\ref{fig:setmodel} are impossible; in the two other case (right column) yes. In two case the distance between two adjacent workshops is the same (top row of Fig~\ref{fig:setmodel}), in two other case (bottom row) no.

	}	
    \end{tabular}
	\caption{Four different experimental Setup}
	\label{fig:setmodel}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Results}
We run 100 simulation for each setup during $10\,000$ steps. For each simulation and at every 1000 timestep we measure the mean of the selected measure of the amphora for each workshop and we calculate the standard deviation of this mean \emph{between} all the workshop. The Figure~\ref{fig:resmod} show the evolution of  this standard deviation for all the simulation in each experimental setup.
    \begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
	\begin{tabular}{m{4cm}m{4cm}}
	    {\tiny \hspace{.4cm}No Horizontal Transmission} & {\centering\tiny Horizontal Transmission }\\
	    \includegraphics[height=4cm]{images/lineNC.png}
	    &
	    \includegraphics[height=4cm]{images/lineC.png}\\
	    \includegraphics[height=4cm]{images/cubeNC.png}
	    &
	    \includegraphics[height=4cm]{images/cubeC.png}\\
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Evolution of the variation of the mean of the observed measure between the workshops for the 4 experimental setups}
	\label{fig:resmod}
    \end{figure}

    We observe that in the cases without vertical transmission the variation between the mean of the measure grows, as every workshop wil slowly change is way to produce amphora without interacting with the other. In the two other case, if all the workshops are close enough, the cultural transmission of knowledge will leave the variation between workshops at a same level. In order to have an increase of the variation in production techniques between the amphora, some strong obstacle in transmission such has a high cost of travel, has to be introduce.


\section{Conclusion}
    
    This suggest that in order to have a suffisant amount of variation between production technic the need for some isolation is mandatory. This could be by spatial isolation or via cultural isolation.
